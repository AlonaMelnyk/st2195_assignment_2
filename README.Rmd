# Practice assignment 2

For this assignment, I will create a GitHub repository called "st2195_assignment_2" that includes:

1.  A README.md file with a short markdown description of this assignment.
2.  A folder called "r_csv" with a R code for scraping the CSV example on cars in the Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values> and saving the resulting output in the local folder (in CSV).
3.  A folder called "python_csv" with a Python version of the code in point 2.
